    <h2 class="text-center">Lemon Chicken</h2>
    <p>Lemon chicken is the name of several dishes found in cuisines around the world which include chicken and lemon. 
    In Canadian Chinese cuisine it usually consists of pieces of chicken meat that are saut√©ed or deep-fried and coated 
    with a thick, sweet lemon-flavored sauce.[citation needed] The Chinese restaurant of the Panda Hotel in Tsuen Wan, 
    Hong Kong, used to serve its version of Lemon Chicken with the chicken pieces coated in batter, then rolled in 
    almond slivers and deep-fried, and served with the lemon-glaze sauce</p>

  <div id="contenuto" class="col-xs-12">
    <h2 class="text-center">Fish fry</h2>
    <p>A fish fry is a meal containing battered or breaded fried fish. It usually also includes french fries,
     coleslaw, hushpuppies, lemon slices, tartar sauce, hot sauce, malt vinegar and dessert. Some Native American 
     versions are cooked by coating fish with semolina and egg yolk.
	Fish is often served on Friday nights during Lent as a restaurant special or through church fundraisers. 
	Beer is a common beverage of choice to accompany a fish fry. A fish fry may include potato pancakes 
	(with accompanying side dishes of sour cream or applesauce) and sliced caraway rye bread if served in a
	 German restaurant or area.</p>

    <p>Biryani, also known as biriyani or biriani, is a South Asian mixed rice dish with its origins among the 
    Muslims of the Indian subcontinent.[1][2][3][4] It is popular throughout the subcontinent and among the diaspora
     from the region. It is generally made with spices, rice, and meat.</p>
